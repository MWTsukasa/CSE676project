# CSE676project

This project involves training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), VGG16, and ResNet18 models on the FER2013 dataset, exploring various optimization techniques influence, including optimization algorithms and training strategies. We systematically applied stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum, and Adam as optimizers plus incorporated weight decay, learning rate decay, and label smoothing as training strategies.Our results demonstrated that the ResNet18 architecture outperformed both CNN and VGG16 models, achieving a superior recognition accuracy of 63.40\% on the FER2013 dataset. The findings of this study contribute insights into the pivotal role of architectural design and optimization strategies in achieving high accuracy on facial expression recognition.
